## ✨ Features

- 📺 **Cinematic Video Player**: Large, center-aligned, aspect-ratio locked media container utilizing HLS.js and native iOS Safari player engines. Supports Picture-in-Picture (PiP), custom volume controls, double-tap seek, and auto-fallback muted play.
- 🚀 **Multi-Playlist Concurrent Loading**: Automatically initiates requests for all default playlists (**Sports**, **Universal**, and **Bangla**) immediately when loading the home page. Displays channel counts instantly and sets the **Sports** playlist as selected by default.
- 💾 **SHA-256 Hash-Based IndexedDB Cache**: Caches each default playlist in the browser using IndexedDB. On page load, it queries a lightweight `/api/iptv/channels/hash?type=...` endpoint. If unchanged, channels load instantly from cache, saving bandwidth and eliminating player lag.
- 📂 **High-Speed BDIX FTP Portal**: An elegant `/ftp` directory showing local BDIX movie and media servers, complete with real-time online status indicators, host configurations, speed diagnostics, and instant redirection link components.
- 👥 **Real-Time Watcher Telemetry**: Integrated directly into the channel list header, using a non-blocking session heartbeat endpoint to monitor active viewers concurrently.
- 🌌 **3D CSS Net Background**: A highly optimized, static 3D perspective cyber grid with deep purple and cyan radial glows and a subtle viewport mesh overlay, designed for maximum performance (0% CPU/GPU overhead) on all devices.
- 🔍 **Interactive Channel Grid**: Filter and search through thousands of Bangla and international live TV channels in real-time. Responsive grid display dynamically adjusts for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.
- ⚡ **Full Skeleton UI Loading States**: Fully unified, custom-designed pulsing skeleton templates for every card element (Player, Details, Developer Info, Total Channels, and Channel List grid) to prevent layout shifts.
- 🧭 **Glassmorphic Sticky Header**: A clean, luxurious sticky header with brand identification and active live broadcast status.
- 📢 **Telegram Announcement Popup**: A beautiful announcement modal prompting users to join the official Telegram channel (`t.me/shajonOTT`) for updates, stream status notifications, and channel requests. Includes a developer-mode bypass for easier testing.

## ⚙️ M3U Playlist Converter

The repository includes a built-in Node.js converter script that automatically scans and parses all JSON files in the data directory and outputs standard M3U playlists.

### Usage

1. **Convert All Playlists** (Converts all `.json` files in `app/data/` to `.m3u`):
   ```bash
   npm run convert-m3u
   ```
   *Or run it directly:*
   ```bash
   node scripts/json-to-m3u.js
   ```

2. **Custom Paths**:
   If you have a custom JSON database or want to output to a specific location:
   ```bash
   node scripts/json-to-m3u.js <path-to-input.json> <path-to-output.m3u>
   ```
